# Surfs Up Weather Analysis
## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to review weather patterns in Hawaii for W. Avy as we look to open a surf and ice cream shop. This analysis is mainly focused on the weather temperature in June and December. When we look at the different statistics between June and December it will aid in the assessment of whether an ice cream/surf shop will have good weather conditions for surfing and the enjoyment of ice cream. These seasonal climate conditions are key determining factors in whether this business model will be successful or not.

This table summarizes June's temperature statistics over time.

This table summarizes Decembers temperature statistics over time.

These two tables tell us about the differing weather patterns for the two monthly periods. Some takeaways:
1) Average temperature between June and December is 75 and 71 degrees respectively, show a moderate temperature and very little fluctuation between the two periods from an average standpoint.
2) the maximum temperatures of 85 (June) and 83 (December) are also remarkable similar.
3) the minimum temperature of 56 (December) and 64 (June) show the greatest variance, and reflects a much lower temperature level in December that may not be conducive to ice cream or surfing. However, with standard deviations of 3.25 (June) and 3.74 (December) we would expect a little more variation in the december numbers.

## Summary
Oevrall the weather in December and June are historically very similar, although December has a wider range of results, with its high being close to June's but its low well below June's.  
When we look at the results of this data set we can see that December's high is very close to June's but December's low is well below June's.Also December's data indicates that is has a wider range of temperatures than June. Given these differences in June's and December's weather, historically the two seasons are very similar.


Other queries that could prove useful in the evaluation of this business model are precipitation and a comparitive evaluation of each weather stations data. The weather station's data closest to the prospective location would provide the most accurate data. The difference in precipation in June vs December would as be valuable as well.
This data will well us if business will be bombing for both seasons or if inclimate weather will turn potential customers away from the beach.
