# Surfs Up Weather Analysis
## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to review weather patterns in Hawaii for W. Avy as we look to open a surf and ice cream shop. This analysis is mainly focused on the weather temperature in June and December. When we look at the different statistics between June and December it will aid in the assessment of whether an ice cream/surf shop will have good weather conditions for surfing and the enjoyment of ice cream. These seasonal climate conditions are key determining factors in whether this business model will be successful or not.

This table summarizes June's temperature statistics over time.

This table summarizes December's temperature statistics over time.

The statics for June and December show us the differences in the seasonal climates. Some takeaways:
1)The average temperature in June and December is 75 and 71 degrees. This shows a moderate temperature and littel variance between June and December.
2) The highest temperatures in June and December were 85 (June) and 83 (December).
3) The lowest temperatures in June and December were 56 (December) and 64 (June). This shows the greatest variance in data. December's lowest temperature is 8 degrees lower than June's.June has a standard deviations of 3.25 and December has a standard deviation of 3.74.

## Summary
 
When we look at the results of this data set we can see that December's high is very close to June's but December's low is well below June's.Also December's data indicates that is has a wider range of temperatures than June. Given these differences in June's and December's weather, historically the two seasons are very similar.


Other queries that could prove useful in the evaluation of this business model are precipitation and a comparitive evaluation of each weather stations data. The weather station's data closest to the prospective location would provide the most accurate data. The difference in precipation in June vs December would as be valuable as well.
This data will well us if business will be bombing for both seasons or if inclimate weather will turn potential customers away from the beach.
